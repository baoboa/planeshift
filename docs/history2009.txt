*** 2009-10-17 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added management of 0 amount transforms allowing to give more time to
  do those transforms and at the same time give additional experience out
  of them
- updated fparser to 3.3.2:
   * Fixed an incompatibility with MS Visual Studio which caused the 
     optimizer to enter an infinite loop with some input functions (VS 
     interprets bitfields slightly differently from gcc). Also minor 
     additions and fine-tuning of the optimizer. 
- committed a fix for PS#2473 - Mouse look prevents from turning  patch by Entur
- forced set position on waypoint reaching on wanderoperation in npcclient:
  allows to workaround slightly bugs in sector changing when npc follow a
  predetermined path in a wander operation
- Added /harvest command
- fixed  PS#2516 - Cannot change color for object labels  patch by kreopt
- Style inprovements in labelentities config

*** 2009-10-12 by Stefano Angeleri
- changed transformations matching to avoid doing useless matching (double
  check of patternless in case no book was in mind) and additional matching
  checking patterns
- updated fparser to 3.3
    *  The Parse() method now performs more exhaustive constant folding 
       (calculating constant expressions at parse time) than before. Also 
       integral powers (eg. like "x^4") are now more optimized at parse time, 
       resulting in faster evaluation even without a call to the Optimize() 
       method (although the latter will sometimes still result in an even 
       better result). The speed impact of this on the Parse() method has 
       been kept minimal.
    * More refactoring of the optimizer, making the Optimize() method 
      significantly faster than in the previous version. Also new and more 
      exhaustive rules have been added, resulting in better results in certain 
      cases (eg. when using basic operators in very complex functions).
    * Added utility member functions to parse a function so that the 
      variables in the function are deduced automatically. The found 
      variables are returned to the caller if requested. 
- committed fix to PS#3193 - Can't resize shortcutwindow.  patch by thomphoenix
- committed a fix for  PS#569 - Annoying camera mode behaviour when camera 
  auto-switches to First Person when zooming in. patch by Entur
- fixed some problems with msvc with fparser
- Fixed some things being parsed as fmt placeholder even if inputed by players
  (eg %s in books which caused server crash if used)
- updated fparser to 3.3.1
  * Fixed some incompatibilities with MS Visual Studio introduced with 
    the refactored optimizer.

- added a script to convert common strings from /planeshift/*/...dds 
  to /planeshift/materials/...dds based on lm-converter

*** 2009-09-23 by Keith Fulton
- Added a new message type called PersistAllEntities.  This is just a
  packed bundle of psPersistActor messages, all inside one
  message.  It is necessary because the server has a large number
  of entities now, and so on startup it can send 1500-3000 tiny
  messages to the npcclient all at once.  The net layer merges
  these into packets as it can, but they are unbundled on the
  other side into messages and they flood the msgqueues.  Sending
  in a single bulk message is a similar result, but with fewer
  enqueued objects to flood with.  Should be slightly more efficient
  in bandwidth as well.

*** 2009-09-22 by Stefano Angeleri
- fixed gm add/edit action location window
- renamed penilty to penalty
- fixed an exploit which allowed to exchange negative amount of money,

*** 2009-09-02 by Stefano Angeleri
- Update last login also on guild join
- merged $npc substitution used in voice file names to the substitutekeywords 
  function and made use of it even to substitute parts of the voice filename so 
  additional keywords can be used there (like $time, $playerrace or $sir)

*** 2009-08-31 by Stefano Angeleri
- Don't play sitting animation if the actor is already in a sit position when
  it's received
- Fixed guild last login informations
- updated fparser to 3.2.1:
    * Fixed bugs in optimizer: Functions in the form "log(-x)"  and certain integral powers 
      (eg. "x^14") were optimized incorrectly. (In the case of the integral powers, the error 
      manifested itself when x==0.)
    * Fixed some incompatibilities which made the library not compile with MSVC.
    * Fixed major crash in FunctionParser::Eval() which happened if it was called without 
      FunctionParser::Parse() having been called successfully (or at all). (Now it always returns 
      0.0 in such situations.)
    * Changed FunctionParser::ErrorMsg() to return an empty string rather than a null pointer if 
      the previous parsing was successful. (Its return value was never intended to be used as a 
      check for success anyways. FunctionParser::GetParseErrorType() can be used for this purpose, 
      if necessary.) This is to avoid potential crashes in the calling program if it assumes that 
      this function always returns a valid string. 
- Added some additional checks fixing PS#1606 - Wrong message when trying to 
  train higher but pp are already 0 
- fixed  PS#759 - Make Small Inventory Window visible at startup

  new data with old one for players
- Fixed some unitialized variables in pscamera which blocked debug builds
  with MSVC to run correctly patch by lanarel
- Better error handling for /morph fixing PS#3112 - 
  Morph commands need better error handling
- Fixed some code which was moved around wrongly in the targeting code

*** 2009-08-25 by Keith Fulton
- Fixed scrollbar to look right in most cases.
- Fixed auto-complete of /commands.
- Improved error reporting for missing images and styles, to help people
  fix custom GUI's.
- Replaced old (broken) skin with new generic skin.

*** 2009-08-24 by Stefano Angeleri
- Updated fparser from 3.1.5 to 3.2:
    *  The FP_SUPPORT_ASINH and FP_NO_ASINH  precompiler constants have 
       been replaced with a more generic FP_SUPPORT_TR1_MATH_FUNCS 
       precompiler constant, which enables other similar functions as well. 
       Consult the documentation on this subject for details.
    * The "asinh", "acosh" and "atanh" functions are now always available 
      in the function syntax regardless of whether FP_SUPPORT_TR1_MATH_FUNCS 
      has been defined or not. (If it's not, then they will be calculated 
      using equivalent formulas.)
    * Significant refactoring of the optimizer code, and addition of 
      numerous new optimization rules (related to the abs() function in
      diverse situations, some exponentiation, logarithm and hyperbolic
      trigonometry optimizations, and others).
    * Fixed bug in the optimizer which caused functions like 
      "sqrt(x*x)" and "(x*x)^0.25" to be optimized incorrectly 
      (for negative values of x). 

*** 2009-08-23 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added public actions/narrate/actionmy support for npcs
- Fixed some bugs with the item prereqop
- Fixed a bug which made the search for name in the area commands only 
  check the first letter in place of the entire string entered

*** 2009-08-10 by Keith Fulton
- Changed buddy notifications to actually use first name of character
  instead of using Client Name, which was coincidentally the first
  name of the character most of the time, but not required to be.
  (Sometimes the email address.)
- This fixes bug #2354, requested by Rizin.
- Also changed buddy notifications to happen when the player enters
  the world instead of when they first connect, which is confusing
  when certain people take a long time to load initially.

*** 2009-08-06 by Keith Fulton
- GUI updates, most notably the configkeys.xml one for Options.
- pawsConfigKeys is now working although it still doesn't look
  perfect.  Whoever wrote the pawsTree code should be taken out and
  shot.
- NB: Very possible that new GUI and new Tree bugs are introduced
  by this set of "fixes".  Please test well.

*** 2009-08-03 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added support for dynamic slot amount per item type (so a forge can have 
  40 slots while a sack 20). Any value from 0 (not really useful as it
  shows actually zero slots) to 83 should work fine. 
- Fixed an exploit.
- Added dynamic image loading when missing from the texturemanager cache.
- Style Fixes.
- Fixed a crash during money pickup although peeg should review this.
- Updated fparser to 3.1.5

*** 2009-08-02 by Stefano Angeleri
- Cleaned up and improved faction events allowing also to not have a strict order on the script
- Made waybread consumable in svn data

- Optimized quickloading by actually loading only the equipment and not items in containers or in bulk

*** 2009-07-29 by Stefano Angeleri
- The menu now don't show anymore the entries the player can't access to because
  the quest is disabled or under lockout. A quest tester can still see all the
  quest (including disabled ones) as he can actually do them and a gm gets
  the same quest of players and the quest under lockout (as he will receive
  an error message in system if he tries them)
- Reworked entirely server side of lifefactionevents allowing any order
  in the script and removing the hashes in favour of the array.
- Fixed group challenges and made the output from challenge invites
  and invites work again
- Added additional messages to group challenge yielding
- Fixed PS#3008 - Pet summon time not correct patch by Tucos

*** 2009-07-25 by Stefano Angeleri
- deputize is now gm2+ and you can deputize up to your level even if not developer

- fixed grammar in system messages
- private notes can be always be edited by the owner (even if without the permission). 
  fixed appending behaviour.
- fixed a wrong name in the giveitem op
- Fixed a bug with exchanging item with an npc when they had a script: 
  made the script run two times and show the npc doesn't need it error
- made a printf a Debug2 so it shows only if quest logging is enabled
- fixed credits window
- added a requestor in Death() this allows messages like you have been struck
  by laanx or you have been struck by zak in place of you have been killed by a gm
  Only who has requested death access can use this (or if used on himself to allow
  the npc to use it too - the admin command manager from npc definitely
  requires some changes)
- Fixed a code flow problem which treathed answers from the requester like
  if it was the first time they were done. This not only blocked the request
  lenght checking (> 2 words) but also didn't allow to reset the advicetimeout
  in case the requester talked (and only did if the advisor talked) increasing
  the amount of useless events being pushed and not allowing to answer effectively
- Added group duels with /groupchallenge <name of a member of a group> and /groupyield
  still needs some refinement but essentially working 
  Fixing PS#1507 - More advanced groups: group vs. group duels. 

*** 2009-07-22 by Steven Patrick
- Fixed PS#2253 - items should not be removed by transient while guarded
- Fixed PS#2341 - TRANSIENT isn't reset if you pick up an item - server 
  crash, patch by peeg.

*** 2009-07-20 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added some additional alliance notifications on join/part/creation/disband
- fixed PS#1555 - Chat filters stop filtering "badwords" if they were part 
  of a previous word in the sentence
- Fixed an overflow in wordnet patch by lanarel

*** 2009-07-19 by Keith Fulton
- Fixed hardcoded path to controlwindow styles.
- Fixed hardcoded path to pawsMoney definition file 
- Fixed pawsMoney creation being hardcoded to certain layouts and
  sizes despite being loaded from a file, which is retarded.
- Changed and centralized how paths to widget files are determined.

*** 2009-07-19 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed crash on questions windows showing patch by lanarel
- Fixed PS#1171 - Popup tutor error
- Fixed PS#3005 - Client crash due to removal of "SystemText" widget
- Fix for zodiac loading patch by lanarel
- Fixed PS#842 - NPCs get chat filtered, we need to not replace text from 
  npcs/npcclient by disabling filters for npc dialogs sent from the server

*** 2009-07-18 by Keith Fulton
- Changed PAWS skin loading to preferentially load widget xml files
  from the skin mounted, then the localization directory, then
  the default /data/gui directory as a last resort.  This means
  someone like Cherppow can deliver an entire working skin in
  one zip file, saved under /art/skins and then it's usable.
- Some additional debug printfs in voicing file protocol, which is 
  still mysteriously not reliable all of a sudden.

*** 2009-07-18 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Fixed PS#1465 - Client fails to detect if server DNS information becomes available

  Improved error messages and checking for more bad data from the item_stats table.
- Fixed PS#2820 - Bad error message by making a more explicit error message
- Fixed PS#969 - cant setskill on pets

*** 2009-07-17 by Kenny Graunke
- Fixed PS#517 by using dynamic binding for pawsSlot::Clear().  This way,
  pawsGlyphSlot::Clear() runs which then resets the stat ID to 0.
  This means that sigClearGlyphSlots clears the assembler correctly.
- Double check if caster is alive just before a spell triggers, as UDP jitter
  can apparently cause spell casts to happen after death.  Fixes PS#2728.
- Made psCharacter::SetLocationInWorld save to the DB on instance changes, not
  only sector changes.  Fixes PS#2151.

*** 2009-07-17 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Merged mount code into trunk, it's now possible to mount npcs of the
  "mount" type.

*** 2009-07-16 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed PS#2347 - Xargon reward has no message

  they attack something. moved also some code which has more sense to be in an actor 
  than in usermanager (stand)

  the selected server. use description="" in the server list to declare it
- Added psnpcclient in the compile group of the mysql plugin as it's required
- Fixed PS#2501 - NPCclient crash when writing logfile. patch by vornne

  Gm can override any check (gm pets can attack everything including the pet itself: but no null!

*** 2009-06-29 by Steven Patrick
- GM2+ may now ban for up to 2 days and unban same, GM4+ can still ban/unban like normal
- Made IP bans optional and disabled by default
- DB BUMP to 1223

*** 2009-06-28 by Stefano Angeleri

- DB BUMP: 1222
- NET BUMP: 0xA0
- added a missing operation when resetting mesh. there was a data incongruency.
- Made bracers/helmets group actually update when changing mesh. so you don't
  see an enki with an ylian help and so on
- Fixed PS#3003 - Reduce unnecessary inline function call half of the patch by HikerHauk

*** 2009-06-22 by Kenny Graunke
- Changed <item> progression script syntax:
  - Made money names singular for consistency with items (and because "trias"
    is grammatically incorrect.)
  - Removed notion of "wallet" location from syntax in favor of simply making
    "inventory" work for both money and normal items.  This means you can no
    longer write semantic nonsense such as:
    <item location="wallet" name="Short Sword" count="5"/>
    Instead, you just get:
    <item location="inventory" name="Tria" count="5"/>
  - The location attribute is now optional and defaults to "inventory".

  the client to untarget them when out of scope
- Made error for wrong username the same as wrong password in order to
  not allow someone to enumerate usernames
- Added new quickpaths life events/parents provided by valrion
- Various fixes and improvements to comment support in math scripts
- Updated fparser from 3.1.3 to 3.1.4:
    * Added new optimizer rules (among others, one which groups common 
      factors of subexpressions, ie. it optimizes functions of the form 
    "a*b+a*c" into "a*(b+c)", where a, b and c are any expressions).
    * Added support for compiling without evaluation checks (because 
      it's impossible to catch all possible error situations in the first place). 
      See the documentation for more info.
    * Dropped the plain text documentation file in favor of the html file. 
- Hide categories in buy dialog when merchant doesn't have items for that
  category
- Added support for dynamic experience based on mob/pc stats
- Added MAXHP, MAXPStamina, MAXMStamina, BaseHP, BasePStamina and BaseMsStamina
  to math script pscharacter properties
- Now the mini inventory won't close if it was already open when opening
  the exchange window patch by Tazen

*** 2009-06-03 by Kenny Graunke
- Restored old code for splitting kill experience, which went missing during my
  scripting system rewrite.  The "kill" progression script is now obsolete.

*** 2009-05-26 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added targeting support to /set (setattrib) and /setkillexp

*** 2009-05-25 by Kenny Graunke
- Fixed Yes/No and OK dialogs to have a background.

*** 2009-05-23 by Kenny Graunke
- Fixed a bug in pawsButton: I opened the options window, selected a pane,
  and clicked "Reset", causing a modal Yes/No dialog to appear...but clicking
  either button gave me "Not still in button so not pressed."  Apparently
  MainWidget->WidgetAt() was returning the widget below the modal dialog.
- Fixed the Options window - there were duplicate "PanelParent" widgets
  (one was mislabeled), causing it to fail to show anything on the right.
- Made teleport set y-rotation, just like it used to.
  ==> NETVERSION BUMP (0x9F) <==

*** 2009-05-22 by Kenny Graunke
- Moved character modes and related data (combat stances, spell cast and work
  events) from psCharacter to gemActor.  Removed a few small things that were
  no longer necessary.

  This is preliminary work on cleaning up the distinction between ps* and gem*.
  Currently, many things appear to be placed in one or the other in a rather
  ad-hoc manner, and this can confuse contributors.  As I see the two layers:

  psCharacter
  - represents a character sheet/intrinsic properties/who the character -is-
  - contains persistent things affecting or belonging to the character
  gemActor
  - supports characters as entities within the world
  - contains transient properties related to what the character is currently -doing-
  
  Note that all gemActors have a psCharacter, but the reverse may not be true.

- Added a new MathScript function: warn("epic fail", 42) evaluates to 42, but
  but also prints "epic fail" to LOG_SCRIPT.  This should be useful for finding
  rule bugs, for example: if (Dmg < 0, warn("Foo: Negative damage!", 0), Dmg)

*** 2009-05-21 by Stefano Angeleri
- fixing PS#2937 - [Trade Window] graphical glitch. Items wheren't removed
  from the exchange window when removed from inventory (eg trough drop)
- Updated fparser to 3.1.3 from 3.1.2:
  Fixed a bug in the optimizer which manifested itself at least in gcc 4.4 

*** 2009-05-17 by Andrew Dai
- Added live position tracking of npcs to the wc live view.

*** 2009-05-17 by Stefano Angeleri
- Made sentence splitting also for ? and !. Now they are threated just
  like "." in quests.
- Fixed harcoded category ids checks in the items details data
- bumped cg to 2.2

*** 2009-05-14 by Kenny Graunke
- Removed loot modifiers which used "target", "wielder", "attack_value",
  or "damage_value", as these were all unimplemented and unused in production.
- Removed position and sector from gemObject, as this copy was rarely used and
  frequently out of date.  The definitive version is in the iMovable.
- Removed y-rotation from gemObject, restoring GetAngle() to work the way it
  did before r3617.  Fixes a bug where player rotation wasn't updating.

*** 2009-05-10 by Andrew Dai
- Removed faction set duplication.
- Fixed a buffer overflow possibility in psGameEvent.
- Reduced NPC command sending interval.
- Removed some slow csQueryRegistry calls from inner loops.
- Fixed npc chasing behaviour by stopping the ChaseOp when there's no hope of
  progress.
- Fixed crash caused by exceeding the max bounds in the kdTree and attempting
  to update the proxlist.
- Added chat channels. Relevant commands are /join /leave and /#
- Removed BinaryRBTree with no small amount of pain.
- Deprecated BinaryRBTree and replaced some existing uses of it with csHash.
  Added const qualifiers to psString.
- Added /? command to show help window.
- Fixed auto setting channel when using /tell.
- Adding aliases for common chat channels.
- Changed NPC turning speed to be more deadly.
- Added very basic view of the server report into gmconsole.
- The last 10 chat messages will now be replayed when the chatwindow is
  loaded. No more digging around in the filesystem.
- Added a LIVE view to viewnpcmap webconsole showing live
  locations of all npcs and players.

*** 2009-05-10 by Stefano Angeleri
- patch for PS#2917 - increased say range in guild houses. Added a column
  in sectors table which specifies the range of the say for that sector.
  patch by Aiken
  DB VERSION BUMP 1219
- patch for PS#2480 - setskill has bad fallback defaults - by making a missing
  value showing up an error in place of silently setting a default one 
  patch by Aiken
- Fixed some warnings from MSVC patch by loyni
- Fixed a bug which didn't allow to set skills as none (-1) for trasformations
  and caused a crash in that case

*** 2009-05-09 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added statue support, which is handled by a column in the character table
  which will set the mode STATUE to the character. this will run the statue
  anim which is just another definition of the idle one and it's put on the
  last frame in order to not make it actually play and make the npc stand
  still (remember to put those impervious).
  In order to make a race work correctly you must add a line like this in the
  cal3d file:
  <animation file="klyrosm_idle.CAF"        name="statue"        type="action"  lock="yes" />
  and then set statue in the character table.
  DB VERSION BUMP 1218
- Fixed a memory leak on ccheck patch by Loyni
- Added a separate Exp optional parameter for the mining experience math script

*** 2009-05-06 by Kenny Graunke
- Fixed terrible movement bugs by reverting two recent changes.
- Changed server-forced position updates (i.e. teleporting) to use a new
  psForcePositionMessage rather than multicasting DR.  These new messages are
  ordered and reliable, while DR updates are neither.  (The server used to
  multicast DR updates as reliable messages, but no longer does so.)
  ==> NETVERSION BUMP (0x9C) <==
- Implement feature request PS#2275 - spell power in /cast command.
  Now you can type /cast 45 Life Infusion to cast with a K factor of 45,
  overriding the value set by the slider in the info window.

*** 2009-05-01 by Stefano Angeleri
- Made a new math script Calculate Trasformation Experience to calculate
  experience gained trough transformations
- Separated the output sent to player from the generic
  experience assignment function
- various cleanups
- Added Comment support to math scripts

*** 2009-04-29 by Kenny Graunke
- Refactored and cleaned server-side teleporting code - there seemed to be
  many different copies, each doing -mostly- the same thing, but not quite.

*** 2009-04-28 by Stefano Angeleri
- Reworked scripts in work manager to call a generic new function which
  attribuites skill practice points and experience based on the execution
  of a generic math script. Reducing copy & paste effect.

*** 2009-04-28 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Changed a few RangeTo calls so that they ignore instances, fixing some ALs.
- Now combines should appear in the crafting book 
  as soon as a transform is available for the resulting item.
- Fix to /drop, which should now work for named items too.

*** 2009-04-28 by Andrew Dai
- The last used chat channel will now automatically be remembered in the
  chatwindow input.

*** 2009-04-28 by Kenny Graunke
- Tentative fix for the guildhouse instance 0 bug.  It's not foolproof, but
  doesn't cost anything and hopefully will prevent it in practice.

*** 2009-04-27 by Andrew Dai
NETVERSION BUMP
- Refactored chatwindow to use PAWS subscriptions so that message types and tab
  assignments now have practically unlimited flexibility.
- Extended PAWS subscriptions to support coloured text in message text boxes.
- Message text boxes now automatically notify parents on change so buttons
  flash automatically.
- Changed default chatwindow to have no tabs for the benefit of new players.
  The tabbed chat window is still supported but will need updates to its
  xml to work after this refactoring.
- Reduced stack usage in some places for easier stack overflow checking.

*** 2009-04-26 by Kenny Graunke
- Exposed IsAdvisorBanned and AdvisorPoints to the scripting system.

*** 2009-04-26 by Andrew Dai
- Fixed problem where npcclient messages were corrupted from ignoring the new
  any range perception.
- Disabled the eventmanager loop warnings.
- Improved npcclient entlist command.
- Fixed client config so the svn client gui shows a little more than a black
  screen.
- Made proxlist debug message more informative.
- Removed duplicates from sql.

*** 2009-04-26 by Kenny Graunke
- Made ActiveSpells cancel on death by default, unless set otherwise (for
  example, for equipment effects).  Should fix PS#173.
- Also cancel them on defeat - should fix PS#1605.
- Fixed MathEnvironment::DumpAllVars to print names; cleaned up MathVar cruft.
- Removed instancing from the tutorial (settings consensus).

*** 2009-04-25 by Stefano Angeleri
- Made the ending quality determination of the item a math script and
  removed so the code from the repair handler function.
- Made the practice experience to be attribuited in the repair operation
  a math script and added exp (PP/200) attribuition in the repair operation.
  The same math script manages both
- Extension in math scripts by lanarel allowing support for rnd(amount).
  before only a value limited to 0<->1 was returned

*** 2009-04-24 by Stefano Angeleri
- Moved some hardcoded operations in /repair in the specific math script
- Updated FPARSER from 2.82 to 3.12 - many optimizations according to change logs
- Added exchange sanity checks for money

*** 2009-04-23 by Stefano Angeleri
- made rankneeded in the repair process a math script

*** 2009-04-21 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Updates to the MSVC compiling guide, credits goes to Bovek

*** 2009-04-20 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added item category prerequisite operator. It allows to check for an item of
  the specified category in the inventory or equipment.
  eg: <item inventory="false" category="Weapon" />

﻿*** 2009-04-19 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Corrected a bug where the wrong gemItem was checked to go through an entrance

*** 2009-04-16 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added Require (not) equipped, Require (not) possessed to quest syntax

*** 2009-04-14 by Keith Fulton
- Auto-give of money now makes change for you in case you don't have the exact change
  the npc is looking for.  Also has the effect of normalizing your coin counts.
- First cut at some unit testing functionality of psMoney.  Update data also to
  get the test script directory.  This is a scriptable interface for writing test
  cases for psMoney without needing to code.  It does not use Google test--just a 
  standalone app.

*** 2009-04-14 by Stefano Angeleri
- Don't show the marry icon when a genderless character right clicks a character
  with a gender and viceversa
- Fixed the attack icon showing in wrong contexts just to then give an error when
  using it. When right clicking someone the icon was shown depending on the
  possibilities of the target and not of the actor as expected.
  Making so gm show an attack icon when right clicked and viceversa they didn't
  get any attack icon if the target couldn't attack them.

*** 2009-04-10 by Keith Fulton
- Initial commit for guaranteed ordering of msgtypes.  (Attention Khaki! :-) )
  Use dev level admin command /rndmsgtest to see it work.  Client-side ordering
  is working here, but server tracking isn't fully implemented yet.  That's next.

*** 2009-04-10 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Add emote logging for PS#2789 - Patch by Loyni

*** 2009-04-07 by Keith Fulton
- Fixed giving money from the popup menu by actually implementing it instead of skipping
  over it.

*** 2009-04-06 by Keith Fulton
- Fixed chained response popups so they don't display until after the npc has finished
  responding.  This prevents confusion and keeps multiple responses from overlapping.

*** 2009-04-06 by Stefano Angeleri
- Committed a patch for PS#2789 - /report improvements  by loyni
- Additional fix for PS#1548 - Battle Helms can be equipped in hands
  now the server will respect the order of the valid_slots definitions in
  the database. fixing issues like helms being equiped by default on hands.
- Fixes by lanarel on some locations.cpp issues

*** 2009-04-05 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Make sure the server does not crash when no pvp regions are defined,
  Patch by Lanarel

*** 2009-04-05 by Stefano Angeleri
- Now the eid of the actor send a chat message is sent to the client which
  in place of searching if he knows some actor with a certain name, just checks
  for it's eid and uses it to show the chat bubble. this fixes some bugs
  like PS#630 Kikiri - bubbles strangeness and problems with players with
  same names (eg: in events) As now the buble goes really to the origin
  of the text and not to a random one (depending on the first in the entities
  list)
- Corrected a wrong fix for a memory leak patch by lanarel

*** 2009-04-02 by Kenny Graunke
- Made the Ring of Familiar actually useful and necessary.  Players must now
  equip it to be able to summon their familiar.  This is accomplished by a new
  ApplicativeScript operation, <can-summon-familiar/>.

*** 2009-04-02 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Fixed a few memory leaks in the server

*** 2009-04-02 by Kenny Graunke
- Implemented the <teleport> imperative script operation.
- Updated the /runscript command for scripting changes.

*** 2009-04-01 by Kenny Graunke
- Added a <destroy aim="..."/> imperative script operation, which destroys the
  given entity, removing it from the world.  Handy for implementing traps.
- Committed my progression script validator.  You need xmllint and command
  line PHP to use it.  Run ./tools/pscript-validator and hope for no errors!
- Removed TARGET_GM in favor of TARGET_FRIEND.  I use that for impervious
  NPCs, so why not invincible GMs?  This allows players to cast healing/buff
  spells on invincible players, once again.
- Fixed a memory leak in RunScriptResponseOp ("bindings" was leaked).
- Fixed a memory leak in CreationManager, which was not unsubscribing from its
  message types.

*** 2009-04-01 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed questmanager to support the new syntax for run, swapped the
  param for give_exp to Exp and make the amount of argument which can
  be passed to Run script in quest scripts dynamic

*** 2009-04-01 by Kenny Graunke
- Improved the syntax of the <run> NPC response.
  - The old syntax was:
    <run scr="..." param0="..." param1="..." param2="..."/>
  - The new syntax is:
    <run script="..." with="Param0 = ...; Param1 = ...; Param2 = ...;"/>
  - Since it uses a MathScript to define the bindings, one can supply
    string literals, define as many variables as one would like, and even give
    them sane names.
  ==> DB VERSION BUMP: 1217 <==
- Updated MathScript unit tests:
  - Fixed expectations to match precision changes from r3303.
  - Added a new test for script lines like Skill = "Sword";
- Hacked MathVars & Statements to detect Area = "Hydlaa"; as a special string
  type, so when we call ToString(), we can get the actual string rather than
  the index into the literals table.  In general, we can't know the type,
  since fparser treats everything as doubles.  It would be very useful.

*** 2009-03-29 by Andrew Dai
- The superclient can now login even if it is already logged in. Existing
  logins are overridden.
- Fixed vel limit in linmove DR messages.
- Fixes bug where tribe members go into infinite respawn, so that npcclient
  now disables NPCs with wrong starting positions.
- Fix to RTO timeout for serverside packets.
- Fixed bug where NPCs would be attackable before npcclient was ready.
- Fixed bug in npcclient where items were mistakenly deleted on a dup packet.
- Fixed bug in user stat regen event timer.

*** 2009-03-28 by Keith Fulton
- New voicing files for the Sammich Quest.  Double-click on Gertie Hollaback to test.
- Took out feature to play each voice file twice.
- Added support for pipe-delimited lists of multiple files in an npc response
  script.
- Added new NetManager command for sending Net messages after a certain delay on
  the server.  This will keep the voice files playing in the right sequence.
- Added time delay to quest assignments and given items.  This will help them sync
  up better with the dialog going slowly instead of happening instantly.
- Slight optimization of SendMessageDelayed, so it sends immediately the old way if
  the specified delay is zero.
- Took out some debug printfs.

*** 2009-03-28 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed PS#2116 - vulnerability against sql injections  by escaping the
  two offending variables before dropping them to mysql.
- Fixed an output glitch with /set list

*** 2009-03-27 by Stefano Angeleri
- Completed the item prereq op. It takes two arguments: if it should search
  in the inventory or only in the equipment slots and the item name which
  can check also for renamed items.
  eg: <item inventory="true" name="Ubersword of Weltall the Klyros" />
- Added a function in psitem to search for items in equipment or the entire
  inventory for the specified item name. It returns true if it was found, false
  if it wasn't

*** 2009-03-27 by Andrew Dai
- Removed send trigger in netbase as this can prevent packets being merged
  together.
- Reduced the select timeout to 10ms since send trigger is removed and to
  reduce network lag.
- Changed minimum proxlist distance to be > 0.
- Made proxlist messages more informative.

*** 2009-03-25 by Andrew Dai
- Reduced lag on connections with packet loss by changing algorithm for
  resending packets to use Jacobson/Karels algorithm to estimate RTT and mean
  deviance in connections and use those to calculate a packet timeout for each
  individual client connection.
- Increased npcclient inqueue size to prevent packet drops on startup.
- Removed some pointless string copying in PAWS.
- Improved performance when checking for duplicated packets.
- Fixed bug in npcclient where duplicates would not be detected since the input
  queue was longer than the packet history so when the input queue fills up,
  dups would not be detected.

*** 2009-03-25 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added quality and maxquality in getsellprice() math script enviroment
  for coherence with getprice()

*** 2009-03-25 by Kenny Graunke
- Switched Clients to use csWeakRef<gemObject> target instead of a bare
  pointer, and removed ClientConnectionSet::ClearAllTargets.  I believe
  this should be safer.  May fix some obscure crashes.

*** 2009-03-24 by Keith Fulton
- Step 1 of supporting multiple voicing files for one response is to allow
  queueing and sequencing of the files.  This commit does that and demos it by playing 
  any voice file twice in a row.
- This commit along with a CS fix also should fix the memory leaks for sounds, where
  sound streams were constantly being added but never removed in the OpenAL renderer.

*** 2009-03-24 by Kenny Graunke
- Improved assertion messages in MathExpression::Evaluate.
- Lowered the precision of MathVar::ToString() to two decimal places, to bring
  spell messages in line with the precision of combat damage messages.
- Fixed a bug where NULL was being supplied to the Calculate Damage script as,
  TargetAttackWeapon.  This occured when the target had a non-weapon in their
  hand.  Yet, this is not sensible, because scripts don't check for NULL and
  just presume the object really exists.  Now we use "Fist", as if the hand
  was empty, so we get a real weapon with a small amount of blunt damage.
- Removed TARGET_NPC and TARGET_PVP target types.  Just use FRIEND or FOE.
  ==> DB VERSION BUMP: 1216 <==

*** 2009-03-24 by Stefano Angeleri
- Made newacct auto enable created accounts, additionally added an optional
  argument to define the security level of the account user/pass/seclevel
  default is security level 0

*** 2009-03-24 by Kenny Graunke
- Fixed an off-by-one bug in MathEnvironment::InterpolateString which caused
  it not to substitute for single letter variables like ${D}.
- Fixed a major bug in psSpellCastGameEvent, which somehow had two copies of
  PowerLevel, set one, and used the other.
- Fixed a major bug where PowerLevel, ChanceOfCastSuccess, and ManaCost were
  supplying numerical skill IDs rather than the character's actual skill rank.
- Converted psWay to use PSITEMSTATS_STAT instead of PSSKILL.
- Ported Borillis' code for the <animal-affinity> script operation to the new
  scripting system.  (It's needed for character creation.)

*** 2009-03-23 by Kenny Graunke
- Integrated RecalculateStats() and CalculateCosts() with Buffables.
- This fixes a bug where buffs were not affecting inventory weight limits,
  among other things.
- Fixed PS#920 by reverting a fix to PS#176 from 2007, then wrote a different
  fix for that bug.

*** 2009-03-20 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed a crash in the /guildinfo caused by the assumption the guild window 
  was always loaded, which is not the case if you aren't in a guild.

*** 2009-03-20 by Andrew Dai
- Fixed npcclient crashes that were referencing a deleted object in MeleeOperation.
- Fixed npcclient crash where script operations were not being reset completely when
  a npcobject is no longer being tracked.
- Also added EventManager reference to BehaviorSets.
- Made NPC AI ticks more flexible so that they are no longer grouped together.
- Increased NPC reactions by reducing delay to 200.
- Increased NPC position resolution by increasing DR updates from once per 2.5 seconds
  to once per 1.5 seconds.

*** 2009-03-19 by Andrew Dai
- Reduced network queue size for clients on server.
- Fixed uninitialized variable in SQL timing statements.
- Fixes to NPC chasing behaviour.
- Changed the CD out of bounds error to be fatal to pick up on nan errors earlier.
- Disables stamina for NPCs which fixes NPCs attacking back and chasing.

*** 2009-03-19 by Kenny Graunke
- Fixed a server crash when lockpicking.  GetSkillRank used to return 0 when
  given an invalid skill ID, but now it triggers an assertion.
- Fixed a bug in MathExpression's parser, which wasn't handling zero argument
  method calls correctly.  Fixes PS#2814.  Also added a unit test.
- Updated the loot generator for the new scripting system.
  It's still not ideal, but should work as well as it did before.
  ==> DB VERSION BUMP <==
- Added a MathScript accessor for character faction.

*** 2009-03-18 by Kenny Graunke
- Added assertions to catch problems earlier, where one might stand a chance
  at deciphering the actual issue.
- Updated fake version of "Flame Spire" to display the amount of damage.
  This should help with PS#818.

*** 2009-03-17 by Keith Fulton
- Made npc_knowledge_areas row in database unnecessary for the KA which is named
  after the NPC.  This enables quest_scripts to work without needed another row in 
  another table anywhere.  The now-redundant rows for specific named KAs in that table
  are harmless though and can stay.

*** 2009-03-17 by Kenny Graunke
- Sync'd CacheManager::CopyItemStats for the new 1214 DB schema.

*** 2009-03-16 by Kenny Graunke
- Fixed substantial memory leaks in the new scripting system.

*** 2009-03-14 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed PS#2798 - NPC items lose quality by setting all equipped items
  back to max quality on respawn.

*** 2009-03-14 by Kenny Graunke
- Fixes to the progression script schema:
  - Switched to <zeroOrMore> for imperative operations to support the
    "Nothing special" character creation options, which are <script></script>.
  - Made <else> optional.
- Made the type attribute optional on imperative <fx> (defaults to attached).
- Improved more error messages when scripts fail to load.
- Added spell table structure conversion to upgrade_schema.sql.

*** 2009-03-13 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Changed the virtual functions in gemObject, implemented in the derived
  classes, to get a pointer to the derived classes. They now are wrapper
  for dynamic_cast to the derived classes.

*** 2009-03-12 by Keith Fulton
- Implemented the riddle prompt functionality from the quest popup menus.
  Use:  Menu: ?=Question Reminder to script this functionality.
  Talk to the Merchant to get this puzzle quest and try it.  "blue" is the correct
  answer to the riddle.  It is quest script 210 if you want to see the example.
- Other warning fixes and data type fixes.

*** 2009-03-12 by Kenny Graunke
- Added MathScript accessors for HP, Mana, and Stamina.
- Fixed "Run script ..." in quests, which wasn't providing the script with the
  necessary actors.  Now it defines "NPC" and "Target" (the player).

*** 2009-03-12 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added attackable flag for gm. Players will be able to attack him like a mob
  but without kill steal protection. It's also the only way to use effectively
  givekillexp
- various improvements in gm gui
- fixed bugs in petition management
- Removed double spaces in /inspect
- Updates to the compiling guide
- Fixed tab width in the chardescription window by caarrie

*** 2009-03-10 by Kenny Graunke
- Converted Buffables to use csArray instead of csList to improve their
  efficiency (memory usage and cache behavior).

*** 2009-03-09 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Fixed PS#613 - You always receive group loot when you're in a guildhouse.  
                 Patch by Vornne
- Fixed PS#2799 - Server crash when uploading character, patch by Lanarel
- Improved the parsing in /rotate, taking into account first axis 
  parameter being 0
- Corrected a loss of target when using /slide or /rotate on items

*** 2009-03-08 by Kenny Graunke
- Fixed a crash when killing an NPC with the /death command.
- Fixed an underflow bug with skills and stats.

*** 2009-03-06 by Kenny Graunke
- Rewrote MathScript, ProgressionScript, and the magic system.

*** 2009-03-06 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Fixed PS#2795 - guarding range ignores instance

*** 2009-03-01 by Stefano Angeleri
- Committed a patch by peeg fixing some little issues in the chardescription
  editing window

*** 2009-03-01 by Stefano Angeleri
- Changed behaviour of the onlinetime prerequisite operator
  now you don't have to pass the type but works like factions so just
  pass max or min and if you need both and two onlinetime operators
- fixed some comments and cleaned up some code
- added Require guild [private/public/], Require not guild [private/public/],
  Require active magic [magicname], Require not active magic [magicname],
  Require known spell [spellname], Require not known spell [spellname],
  Require race [Racename as per db], Require not race [racename as per db],
  Require gender [male/female/neutral], Require not gender [male/female/neutral],
  Require married, Require not married to the quest script syntax allowing
  so more dynamic quests without doing many duplicates.

*** 2009-02-24 by Stefano Angeleri
- Updated gm gui to the new paws specifications
- Fixed PS#2785 - [pawscrollbar] Keeps scrolling undefinitely even when
  not clicking. pawsscrollbar onbuttonrelease() was forgot with the
  old definition and so it wasn't called anymore making scroll not work
  correctly while clicking on arrows.
- Placed a sleep in the main loop so the client doesn't take all the cpu
  in case no drawing is being done

*** 2009-02-23 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Fixed PS#2496 - Guild shows in an alliance 

*** 2009-02-22 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Fixed PS#2722 - Can't place money there
- Fixed  PS#2595 - pickup command should need a target

*** 2009-02-22 by Stefano Angeleri
- Removed a Show() in the groupwindow which would have displayed each
  time there were member changes the window disregarding the user choice
  to hide it (this made the window extremely annoying considering left/join
  notifications are already in chat)
- Added a language selection in pslaunch
- Updates to the italian language with new strings and additional
  translated strings

*** 2009-02-21 by Stefano Angeleri
- Updated the gm petition window to the new paws version and improved
  placements of parts of it
- Added a gm column in the gm petition window showing the gm who has claimed
  currently a petition
- Fix for PS#1714 - ability for gms to view all petitions even if claimed.
  By allowing all to see always all petitions, even claimed ones and only
  gm5+/devs can unclaim them, removed also some redundant code and variables
- Fix for PS#2775 - Petition notification - By requesting immediately the
  petitions and setting haspetinterest true, additionally changed the
  Petitions are waiting message to New petition from (name from the last
  petition submitted
- Change the OnButtonPressed to OnButtonReleased in the gm petition window

*** 2009-02-21 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Changed the array of emote in UserManager to be a hashmap
- merged the Validate() security level checking wrapper from adminmanager
  into HasAccess() from psserver, renamed HasAccess() to CheckAccess(),
  changed various commands in usermanager and adminmanager to use the new wrapper
- moved DecodeCommandArea() from UserManager and FindObjectByString()
  from AdminManager to msgmanager, where they will be easily reusable
  by both classes

*** 2009-02-20 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added instance sliding with /slide.
  The command is /slide (target) I slideamount, slide amount is relative
  the the current instance of the target

*** 2009-02-18 by Keith Fulton
- PAWS update
   1. Now syntax of <pawsButton bla.bla></pawsButton> is supported instead
      of cumbersome <widget factory="pawsButton" bla bla></widget> syntax.
   2. styles now work and support repeated tags.
   3. image definitions can now be horizontal or vertial "3-patches" where the
      middle part automatically tiles.  They can also be rectangular "9-patches"
      where the middle parts of the edges repeat on the edges and the middle part
      tiles in the middle to accommodate any widget size.  These can be used
      interchangeably wherever single images used to be used.
   4. CTRL-ALT-Click on the Close Box of a window now reloads that window xml file.
      This is not guaranteed not to crash the client but a lot better than exiting
      and reloading every time you tweak a widget position 1 pixel.
   5. Also changed the default button behavior to use OnButtonReleased, not OnButtonPressed.
      This equates to processing the button on mouse up, not mouse down, which is
      the way every GUI in the world works.  We need to change all windows to do
      this correctly.
   6. A number of windows have been redone to support the above.
- Miscellaneous fixes discovered during the above.
- Restyled Help Window and Spell Window

*** 2009-02-18 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Patch for PS#2744 by Loyni - ambient sound and voices options now

- Various fixes and clean ups by kougaro
- Completed work on the new descriptions
- Fixed an issue which would stop the player from editing his custom
  life events if there was nothing in the tab
- Added the possibility to add little scripts which will define dynamically
  generated life events based on the character faction points. The script
  must be ordered from the absolute highest value to the lowest one. The
  fact a number is negative doesn't matter so: 20 10 is correct, 20 -20
  10 -10 is correct, 10 -20 is correct but 10 20 -10 -20 and 20 10 -10 -20
  are wrong.
- Added some sample data to faction.sql to demonstrate the dynamic life
  events function, part of it was provided by Xillix
- Some commenting improvements
- Tab/spaces fixes
- Added race and gender quest prerequisites for race it's
  <race name="Klyros"/> for gender it's <gender type="M"/>

- Added a faction_character column in the faction table which should store
  how the dinamyc faction should be applied in the life events of a character
- added a life_description column in character which holds the editable
  part of the char creation/life events tab in the character description

- Major upgrade to PAWS capabilities in this commit.  Most of this functionality
  was already here but unused or not working right.  Here is an explanation of
  what is possible, with pointers to examples:
    1. Anywhere an image is needed, you can now use a tilable stretchable image.
       This images can be made with 3 components to stretch horizontally, 3
       components to stretch vertically, or 9 components to stretch both directions.
       See the new imagelist.xml in default.zip for examples of these.
    2. PAWS styles now work much better.  In any <widget> tag you can specify
       style="whatever" and the xml for that style in /data/gui/styles.xml will
       be dropped into that widget.  This means anything can be overridden with
       styles.  Backgrounds, fonts, and the next feature.
    3. New widget subtag, <defaultstyle>.  This allows you to specify for a
       widget that any widget with the named factory should get the named style
       unless overridden locally.  For example:

          <defaultstyle factory="pawsButton" style="redbutton"/>

       If this is specified at a parent level, then all buttons in this widget
       will use the redbutton class without having to specify it each time.

       If this is specified inside a style, then any widget getting this style
       will use the "redbutton" style for any of this widget's buttons.

       By specifying defaultstyle's for many factories in a standard style,
       we should be able to pull out nearly ALL style information from the 
       widget definitions and only store them in 1 place.

  (Net Version bump)

*** 2009-01-15 by Kenny Graunke
- Implemented targeting by ItemID(*) for admin commands, i.e.
  "/teleport itemid:407 here".  This will be immensely useful when working
  with container ALs, as they only specify ItemID, not EID.
  
  (*) "ItemID" means psItem/item_instance UID, not item_stats.  If you find
      any incorrect uses, please rename them to "ItemStatsID" for clarity.

*** 2009-01-14 by Stefano Angeleri
- Comment fixes by kougaro
- Made npc rotate back to their original position after talking with
  them patch by kougaro
- fixed /inspect being cut by the packet size limit
- /deputize now allows devs to set up to their level differently than
  gm who keep the <their level - 1> rule

*** 2009-01-13 by Stefano Angeleri
- Changed tabs to spaces and trimmed ending spaces
- Added the possibility to load/save descriptions from file.
  They are stored in /description/char_name_description.txt and ca be
  easily loaded with a button from the char description editing window

- Committed patch by Electricsheep fixing
  PS#2632 - resizing the chardescription edit window. with some
  refactoring from me
- Updates to the compiling guide
- Added OOC tab help by doshot

*** 2009-01-10 by Keith Fulton
- Now PaladinJr will not report teleports or shifts as cheat moves.
- Restructured the allowed lag calculations significantly.  Khaki if you're out there
  your review would be appreciated.
- Left in the debug printf spam intentionally to help the testing team help me figure
  out where the remaining problems are.
- Final functor messaging conversion is completed.
- Renamed psWorkManager to WorkManager for consistency.  I think all the "ps" prefixes
  are now gone from the Manager level anyway.

*** 2009-01-10 by Stefano Angeleri
- Ignoring quest prereqs when questtester is set
- Made an error message in crafting more visible

*** 2009-01-07 by Steven Patrick

  and puzzles.

*** 2009-01-07 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed NPC camera collision detection it was skipping the code acting
  always as with collision detection disabled

*** 2009-01-06 by Keith Fulton
- Changed sector specifier in npc_spawn_ranges table to be a FK directly
  to the sectors table instead of a common string with the name of the sector
  in the string.  This is a tighter structure for this table.
  DB VERSION BUMP.
- On a side note, Aiken has tested this functionality and it does work.
  We should use it.
- Fixed crash if the speex plugin isn't available, which has the effect of the 
  file being found but the data still unable to be loaded (crashes the client).
- Fixed crash in npc /give check for frozen targetClient
- Now quests break up dialog into different say commands, one sentence at a time.
  The objective of this is to make the chat (and chat bubbles) more readable and
  give better pacing with the eventual audio files.

*** 2009-01-06 by Dave Bentham
- Progression scripts can be kicked by mini-games when won, by adding
  script='prog_script_name' to the action_location. In script terms, the
  winner = actor, loser = target.

*** 2009-01-06 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed FS#1548 - Battle Helms can be equipped in hands.
  The code replaced $H (which is used only for replacements for helms
  and most probably was intended so) only in case the helm was in the
  helm slot making it impossible to get the right mesh if you hold
  it in the hands for example. Also removed the definition of a psstring
  to use replaceallsubstring as the replaceall in crystal space csstring
  does already what's needed avoiding useless assignments and conversions

*** 2009-01-05 by Keith Fulton
- Now Paladin detects speed hacks and kicks you off the server if you run too quickly
  for more than a few seconds.  Needs to be tested more by the Testing team if
  possible for false positives mostly.
- New fixed version doesn't hardcode max speed to always be 1.  :)

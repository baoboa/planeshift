#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CS_MSG_ERROR(ERROR-DESCRIPTION, [EXIT-STATUS])
#	A convenience wrapper for AC_MSG_ERROR() which invokes AC_CACHE_SAVE()
#	before aborting the script.  Saving the cache should make subsequent
#	re-invocations of the configure script faster once the user has
#	corrected the problem(s) which caused the failure.

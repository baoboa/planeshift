# CS_PACKAGEINFO([LONGNAME], [COPYRIGHT, [HOMEPAGE])
#	Set additional information for the package.  Note that the version
#	number of your application should only contain numbers, because on
#	Windows you can only set numerical values in some of the file
#	properties (such as versioninfo .rc files).

# CS_EMIT_PACKAGEINFO([EMITTER])
#	Emit extended package information using the provided EMITTER.  EMITTER
#	is a macro name, such as CS_JAMCONFIG_PROPERTY or CS_MAKEFILE_PROPERTY,
#	which performs the actual task of emitting the KEY/VALUE tuple.  If
#	EMITTER is omitted, CS_JAMCONFIG_PROPERTY is used.  For backward
#	compatibility, if EMITTER is the literal value "jam", then
#	CS_JAMCONFIG_PROPERTY is used; if it is "make", then
#	CS_MAKEFILE_PROPERTY is used; however use of these literal names is
#	highly discouraged.

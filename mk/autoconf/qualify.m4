# CS_SYMBOL_QUALIFIER(MESSAGE, CACHE-VAR, QUALIFIERS, [SYMBOL], [LANG],
#		      [ACTION-IF-ACCEPTED], [ACTION-IF-NOT-ACCEPTED])
#	Test if a symbol can be qualified by one of the elements of the
#	comma-separated list of QUALIFIERS.  Examples of qualifiers include
#	__attribute__((deprecated)), __declspec(dllimport), etc. MESSAGE is the
#	"checking" message. CACHE-VAR is the variable which receives the
#	qualifier which succeeded, or the the literal "no" if none were
#	accepted. SYMBOL is the symbol to which the qualifier should be
#	applied. If omitted, then SYMBOL defaults to "void f();". LANG is the
#	language of the test, typically "C" or "C++". It defaults to "C" if
#	omitted. ACTION-IF-ACCEPTED is invoked after CACHE-VAR is set if one of
#	the qualifiers is accepted, else ACTION-IF-NOT-ACCEPTED is invoked.

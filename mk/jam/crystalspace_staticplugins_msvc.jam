# This is an example on how to include the MSVC static plugins information
# for external projects.
# The information itself is split across multiple files, one for each
# supported version of MSVC; the files for the desired MSVC versions must
# be included (usually all).

# The inclusions below are of examplary nature and would only work within
# the source tree of CS. For an external project you could either directly
# refer to the files inside CS or a copy in your project's sources; either
# way, the include statements below would obviously have to adjusted 
# appropriately.

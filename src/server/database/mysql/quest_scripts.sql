I give you... the Sandwich Plate! [Reginald gingerly places an elderly serving plate in your hands. It is quite chipped and contains four sections, each in a different, and somewhat gaudy, colour.] When you have given this magnificent object the reverence due to it, tell me you are ready and I will impart its sublime knowledge to you.

Every part of the Sandwich has its proper place during assembly. The bread is placed in the fuchsia section in the centre. The meat must always reside in the cerulean section, just there.

It is the condiment which binds the Sandwich together into a cohesive whole that is better than the sum of its respective parts.
